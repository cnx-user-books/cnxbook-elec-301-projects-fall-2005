  <title>Overview</title> 
  <para id="id52337719">Although seemingly subtle, accents have
important influences in many areas â€“ from business, to sociology,
technology, security, and intelligence. While much linguistic
analysis has been done on the subject matter, very little work has
done with regards to potential applications.</para>

<title>Goals</title>
<para id="id50932569">The goal of this project is to generate a process for accurate accent detection. The algorithm developed should have
the flexibility to choose how many accents to differentiate
between. Currently, the algorithm is aimed at differentiating
accents by languages, rather than regions, but should be able to
conform to the latter as well. Finally, the application should
produce an output showing the relative strength of a speaker's
primary accent compared to the rest in the system.</para></section>

<title>Design Choices</title>
<para id="id52817206">The agreed-upon option for achieving the
desired flexibility in the project's algorithm is to use a neural
network. A neural network is a matrix containing weights that
correspond to how certain parameters fed to the network tie the
inputs to the outputs. Parameters of known inputs with
corresponding outputs are fed to the network to train it. Training
the network produces the weighted matrix, to which test samples can
then be fed. This provides a powerful and flexible tool that can be
used to generate the desired algorithm.</para><para id="blah"> Utilizing this limits the
project group only by the amount of overall samples collected to
train the matrix with, and how they are defined. For this project,
approximately 800 samples from over 70 people have been collected
for the purposes of training and testing. The group of
language-based accents to test with consists of American Northern
English, American Texan English, Farsi, Russian, Mandarin, and
Korean.</para></section>

<title>Applications</title>
<para id="id28103348">Potential applications for this project are
incredibly diverse. One example might be for tagging information
about a subject for intelligence purposes. The program could also
be used as a potential aid/error check for voice-recognition based
systems such as customer service or bioinformatics in security
systems. The project can even aid in showing a student's progress
in learning a foreign language.</para></section></section>
