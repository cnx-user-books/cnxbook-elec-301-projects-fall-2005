<para id="id51641480">Using a function to repeatedly analyze ECGs
with our algorithm, we obtained rates of correctly identifying the
right type of rhythm and heart rate for specified noise levels. We
then plotted these rates versus the corresponding SNR value for
each noise level to see how much noise we could tolerate before we
could no longer accurately detect the signalâ€™s information. Below
are these particular graphs for an 80 BPM Sinus wave, a 100 BPM
Inverted T wave, and a 108 BPM Ventricular Tachycardia wave.</para>

<para id="id2786627">As shown in the graphs, all signals can be
correctly identified with a SNR as low as 4, at which point the
Sinus wave starts to look like a Ventricular Tachycardia wave due
to noise. The other two signals we tested correctly identify the
rhythm all the way down to a SNR of about 1.5. As far as heart rate
goes, the Sinus and Inverted T wave always calculate the correct
hear rate within two beats per minute for all signals with a SNR as
low as 3, while a Ventricular Tachycardia signal can only do so.
For practical purposes the one to two beat deviation in beats per
minute may be considered negligible as all patients exhibit slight
variances in heartrate from one moment to the next and such a small
variance is insignificant for medical purposes anyway.</para>
<para id="id51759878">The fact that the filter and the deciphering
algorithm can tolerate such low signal to noise ratios shows great
promise. Though this success rate may be lowered slightly as we add
more signal types to be identified, it seems fairly certain that
even for a relatively large number of signal types we would still
be able to identify the correct rhythm for any reasonable SNR
value.</para>
